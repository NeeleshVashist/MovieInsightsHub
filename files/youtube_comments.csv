lcOqUE0u1LM,"Merveilleux  film, je l'ai vu depuis des années mais ses événements ont resté gravés dans ma mémoire"
0hu12MP7b1U,Its a perfect film.
t2QcA-KoF5s,Kevin Spacey - winning Oscar Best Actor for this movie and he deserved it 100%
5Pp64srMAH4,Just finished it and i said to myself after seeing Kevin spacey in the movie that what if he's the soze in the end seeing that he's shown weak like that just a thought came in mind in the start but loved how they end it with these 2 lines amazing work 🙌 #theusualsuspects
xgIHRczRE1Q,"I held off watching this movie because the ending got spoiled for me and i can't even remember where or when that happened. Nevertheless, I'll watch it now."
15s4Y9ffW_o,What a trailer!!
yuzXPzgBDvo,"RM Same old scene, usual deception"
a-tLJ-OXN9I,Thanks to Palmemtieri.
OXc0-EME0C8,Greatest mystery thriller of all time
znmZoVkCjpI,"*SPOILER ALERT*
I watched this movie with my mom once. We both love mysteries and she told me this movie was one of her favorites so we sat down to watch it, and within 5 minutes I turned to her and said, ""it's him, its kevin spacey right?."" 
She just looked at me in shock with her jaw dropped and said, ""how the hell did you know that?.""
I told her, ""it's always the one you least expect."" 
She couldn't believe it. 
Good times 🤣"
oiXdPolca5w,His name was CAT BRANCHMAN
6hsIc9reo7k,⭐⭐⭐⭐Must Watch
SgbbmwHpoAA,is it just me or anyone else thought that kint was soze from start
jPt_INy_CtM,One of the best movies - and endings - ever made.... a masterpiece of story telling
7YnfJEgTBGA,This is like by far the greatest movie ever...
jNuIn4T-CLk,Whos shit
jL4l_tyPC0Y,"So much atmosphere tension, dock scenes fabulous,acting at its very best."
3n1O-sKecdA,That narrator's voice was nostalgic.
bdqnz-FtIog,It's a shame that director turned out to be a pedo...and that story of Kevin Spacey on set. Man...Bryan Singer and Kevin Spacey 2 talents with some horrifying pasts
KLUdKoCganU,"Together with Black Panther, this is another overrated movie."
nMft5QDOHek,Bollywood tried to copy this one too🤣🤣🤣
T5IligQP7Fo,10/10
q7vg8uGzLts,"Seems like everyone had this movie spoiled one way or another. I got it spoiled when i walked into the living room where my grandpa was watching it and TV was playing the last few minutes of the movie. I didn't think about it or care, but years later i was watching the movie and immediately remembered the scene and realized it was from the end. I realized what the twist was. Still enjoyed it, great movie. They don't make them like this anymore. 90's had some great thrillers. Like The Game and 7even."
P7FcPlt8hHc,"I've had plenty of films spoiled for me in my time, but this is the only movie I've ever been actively angry about having spoiled. Once it's spoiled, it's impossible to forget. A brilliant ending"
WPsbUcvKzxQ,Kevin spacey is k…. S…… for those who came for trailer 🥺
Xm12NSa8jsM,"you know what would have been a great ending (I don't hate the actual ending this is just my opinion ) 
the cripple  guy walk out of the police station and got into a taxi then the taxi blows up not far from the  police station ...so at the final time the police thought that kaiser soze is that oldish guy with a lawyer girl friend so the cripple dyeing in a taxi they will fig it was him ...he finally killed him for some reason and they would close the case on  the cripple guy ...after that he will walk free with out no search on his back from the cops ...
' The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn`t exist""  Right ????😅"
KtEIMC58sZo,This movie is the biggest mindfuck ever.
ROLvjRB4E_Q,"Lots of people do believe the devil exists!  If only ""he"" didn't!"
gC1lO7lqMuw,"Just saw this movie, no one could have predicted the ending"
I3ItZQb-GLM,"And he showed those Men of Will, what WILL really was!"
4FJiTCAmD4k,sucks that i got spoiled who keyser soze is when i didnt even know the name of this movie.
G3_vC5kSU6A,"I’m very open minded when it comes to movies / genres etc 
But I see no redeeming qualities in this movie at all whatsoever…. It was boring and pointless - plain and simple !"
PZM-vG8DcRc,"I sat through the movie to see how the officers were going to connect the dots & identify the real thing but alas that never happened! 


Nevertheless a very interesting watch."
SFnK1abzS9E,Переведите на русский

P2yNnEhsFno,Saw it coming but was so my engaged till the last second
V2Q40rXJuMU,Funny to see Gus Fring here
Mlfn5n-E2WE,"💯The odds that we will ever see movies of this caliber being produced again in the USA are extremely low. 

With all the political correctness and woke corporations, you’re limited to promoting fat women as leaders over men, transsexuals as normal, and Black people to get leading roles to achieve a quota."
34WwXUlx7E4,Kevin Spacey needs to get back into acting.
CG5yOZ7DO18,"Directed by Brian Singer and starring Kevin Spacey, two of the most noble men in Hollyhood."
l7pKpO8NErU,One of the best
w6TdqnXSLaM,Kevin Spacey was a genious in acting.

Y5povsMKfT4,Background mystery music at its best♥️
aNQqoExfQsg,BEST EVER MYSTERY THRILL♥️

How did that Hungarian guy from the hospital see keysar? And how did he know it was him if only arturro had seen him? And why did keyser/verbal hang around after the explosion so the police could pick him up? And why go to all the trouble of pulling strings to get himself immunity if he was gonna spill to the detective anyway? Why did drop all those clues so the detective could figure out who he was? I guess you could say he was playing mind games and his motive was to spread fear and let the people know he was behind it but then the whole point of his operation was so no one could recognize him (which he failed in seeing that the Hungarian and now the detective know his face)."

YQRbTNN-jNE,Capolavoro assoluto del cinema internazionale
T98FhmNPzkU,체밌어요칠퍼세요🎧
99cKEAvGf7g,One of my favorite movies of all time.
dx2dn4bvuBE,"the character of Mr Holland was inspired by my current teacher Mr Eisenhart, I didn't know this and I've been his student for two whole years..."
tD3TI8bEOug,The old age make up nailed what Dreyfus would look like in his later years.
a3qcNyjj9ZQ,Went to this movie not knowing what to expect and just loved it.  I had a music teacher like him.  He was my favorit teacher.  He had a temper big time but he gave a damn.   He was an anomaly in the 60s a Christian Lebanese.  Broke my heart when he left to become an Evangelist.  Just missed catching up to him half way across the country. By 1 dang day.   Think he's passed now.
OgG2jfBfLzI,"I was searching for 
""Mrs Holland's Old Puss""..."
yGxtGxVZiAM,On my list of must watch and must have movies!!
Ogp5KYh9xUA,Rest in peace Jay Thomas
B1E7h3SeMDk,One of my favorites.
rhhI_qYOacw,"I watched this for the first time last night, and it was so good. A professor of mine suggested this. I searched it on my Roku last night. Truly remarkable. Plus, I am a music major who plays percussion"
lKWiQLwr9Xs,Had the honor of meeting Dreyfuss today at Cincinnati Comic Expo; truly an amazing man in person. So kind and told me this movie was one of his most honorable movies because he belives teachers are some of the hardest working people we have in this country.
UffK-IHM1B0,"The biggest point that this movie made ,to me, was how the arts program is always the first school program to be sacrificed 
If schools don’t have an arts program, they may as well shut down all programs.
One I know my kids school would Never shut down would be the Football program….
God Forbid !
Can’t shut down a program that makes big money !
The years my kids were in band 
They constantly did well 
The band programs still are.  
The football program has its ups and downs but the support is always there.
Thanks to the community supporting both , both have thrived in many aspects.
So have other areas in sports and arts.  
The minute any school administration forgets that !
They have failed their community !"
apduYg2VqTI,Great movie
pBISMUzU0Xo,Dreyfuss...what do you love most about you?
UaVTIH8mujA,Terrence pay attention
KsBcuVOkEsg,He deserved an Oscar
ToCMwdOaWh4,:30//It's a good thing Meryl Streep (Roberta Demetrius) wasn't teaching.  She would have told them off!
H9PFVthayBE,명작!
KlZ4fYqjGJI,after all these years this movies touches me everytime i see it on tv. very great movie. ending brings me tears in my eyes every time no matter how old i am.
njdreZRjvpc,"Make sure to bring a barf bag if you plan on making it to the end of this movie, Highschool Over Rated. On second thought, bring a second barf bag as that first one can fill up surprisingly quick from the endless corny dialogues and tired clichés."
0X94oZgJis4,"I just saw this film for the 1st time on free TV.  I only saw the last 40 minutes but it was enough to leave an impact on me, especially the end of the film.  It reminded me of a time that I went to my little boy's school assembly about 3 years ago. They announced that one of the teachers was leaving. The teacher stood in the audience and he just gave a bit of a wave and that was that. I kept watching and one of the male students in his class started crying. The teacher and other students tried to console the boy. All the students of that class had tears in their eyes. I was awestruck. I hope that teacher knew how special he was. A million dollars could not buy that. I still feel emotional just thinking about it even though it had nothing to do with me.  Cherish the little things in life. And the special times. That's probably why we are here, anyway."
8dxh3lwdOFw,What a great movie
oR_e9y-bka0,"I always loved Alicia Witt in this movie but didn't then recognize her right away when I saw her in later Hallmark movies.  Her role here was wonderful!  And now that she has lost her parents (December 2021, tragically), the line in this Trailer seems all the more meaningful. <3"
mpJSB4Gbljc,What a european film
lQQhoYLsoHI,"Watched it when it first came out, as a kid. Throughout all my turmoil, I remembered it. Specific moments. Him cheating on his wife. The wife discovering the child was deaf. The realization for both of them. The child realizing, the father realizing, sound, is movement, and emotion, and far more then what either could have forseen. It changed my perception, and though my own disabled children were not deaf, they were nonverbal, and it was part of my learning, understanding, this movie."
CFSmoKm6c5A,"I just watched this on Disney + and I was not prepared. Yes, I cried 😭. Dreyfuss deserved an oscar."
gn3gK27HIsw,Sad movie.  The whole thing is about a guy who failed at the most important thing ever…being a dad.
ceOXz_DVLCA,Under distributed outside the U.S. through MGM Studios.
BdHWQOhs1x4,This movie is so underrated. How underrated? I donate every month to the Mr. HOLLANDS OPUS FOUNDATION. EDDIE VAN HALEN DOES TOO. THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING. I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IN 1997. I GOT GRINDED OUT THRU LIFE. MILITARY AND THEN THE FEDS. I GET BURNT OUT AND I GET TIRED. THIS MOVIE IS A CHAMPION TO A LOT OF GUYS. AND SOME GIRLS. THIS AND RUDY THATS OUR SHIT. ITS NOT THE WAR ITS THE SPIRIT. THIS MOVIE MADE ME ADONATE TO KIDS AND I HAVEN'T STOPPED WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU....
8xHM7TNxg3s,I just like love this movieeee sooo amazing and emotional! Me as a current high school clarinetist can relate and I just want to thank my band directors and overall teachers more!
bZNcqtx83Io,"Rest In Peace Olympia Dukakis  :(  

Richard should have gotten the Oscar for this, not Nicolas Cage for Leaving Las Vegas!!"
jaJuwKCmJbY,I watched this at my old Town down movie theater back when it was released in theaters and the movie film sadly broke at the end and was skipping in most parts but after 15 and 11 years later I got to watch it over and over in its entirety. I enjoyed every minute of it and richard Dreyfuss is one of my favorite actors
zzwPuJklv4w,"This is a very, very, very good movie! I love it!"
NFac_MOWFBs,Jean Louisa Kelly should have been a bigger movie star
oDuma1M09B0,Boring
jGsiY-2CkPU,"Great movie, but I hate how the trailer spoils the whole movie lol"

nWCct8XbQD0,"is this movie really that great, i mean 🍿 🥤 worthy?"
2cBja3AbahY,Young Terrence Howard at 0:46
VDC1SUlXuGI,TISS brought me here..
0WTwVpEEMps,"I was in Jr. High in 98-99 and this must have been my band director's favorite movie.  Every time he had a substitute or we had free time he would always put this movie in.  We never got to watch the full thing of course, but thankfully I was able to watch it all tonight (thanks Disney+).. feel just a little old now haha.  Such a great movie and it was nice to relive those memories in the band room watching bits and pieces of this movie, even if a few of us grumbled about it haha."
TKPmGjVFbrY,Came to watch the trailer because I saw this movie is now on Disney+!
eIcmQNy9FsM,what you learn from this lol
vayksn4Y93A,It was very touching. Excellent
R8weLPF4qBQ,The trailer tells too much.

Y85sfYVOS84,Rest In Peace Glenne Headly.
a1AMga5GaEQ,yay
4zbpL3LeW7k,This movie is fucking absurd.
rDJXPiyvQfg,I see a lot of people myself included seeing this movie and not knowing about the vampires. Was this not the OG trailer before release or did that many people just watch it without the trailer? I think at the time 1996 their just was no internet to the point that you could see trailers for movies. It was either you saw the trailer on TV or did not see the trailer.
EfKFPktklmA,I remember going to see this movie and never saw the trailer. So was shocked when Salma Hayek head turned into what I thought at the time was a SNAKE head!! Had no idea about Vampires (because I never saw the trailer....until today lol)
KTuip4gVJWg,"I saw this for the first time last night, loved it! 🖤"
urRkGvhXc8w,This is Jumpscared!!!💀💀☠️☠️

0xQSIdSRlAk,"Aku mengagumi George Clooney dalam film ini,i luv it ! 🥰❤️👍 . Lakonan nya sangat berkesan dalm film ini ."
ZKPFC8DA9_8,bro wtf trailers used to literally just explain the whole plot 😭
oSeQQlaCZgU,Broooooooooo why did I think I imagined this movie all these years! I'm only 27 so I had to have seen this at an early age 😮
IFNUGzCOQoI,One of the best movies
TEN-2uTi2c0,"Scream Queen 👑 It's a Joy Ride Reference, but specifically it's the Dr. And her husband from Planet of Terror (Their whole Storylines in this movie 🎥) Huh; These Tarantino nods R fun! And the movies a great 😃 watch ⌚ Tell your friends! Have fun guys!"
T54uZPI4Z8A,Scream Queen 👑 Now who else is there The Truck Driver Black sheep 🐑 Looking 4 his Candy Cane (You see him at the Red Bar me and Faith work at in the Beginning
9l-ViOOFH-s,"Scream Queen 👑 and because BUGS is my 2nd Dirtiest Tarantino movie, I thought Why not, Let's put The 🙀Twister in it, (They're not Vampires but Kai does go 2 see Santanica Pandemonium, But I thought you were a.... I like Girls 2,"
7L8p7_SLzvU,Great movie but to get the best experience it's far better to watch it without knowing anything about it - especially don't watch the trailer first.
2ilzidi_J8Q,Watched this without knowing it was a vampire movie! Blew me away!! Best movie ever!!
jQ5lPt9edzQ,Whats the song name what was played at the begin? Pls
UHZQEtG8xYo,"Hey, the mysterious voice forgot to mention Salma Hayek and the rest of the cast."
Wz719b9QUqY,"The last line got me lol.. ""welcome to slavery, no thanks Ive already had a wife"" 🤣🤣🤣
Quentin once said, a scene where he had Salam Hayek's foot in his mouth, was added because it added cinematic value to the film, and led it to valuable character development. Not meant to be cringe.. but seem like it is lol. And we all know, secretly he also wanted it, or might even loved it to a certain extend 🤣. Loveee QT!"
2HCR4c1zPyk,Magnífica película de terror
9O1Iy9od7-A,My family rented this not knowing anything about it. We just thought we were just watching george clooney movie about criminals on the run and out of absolutely nowhere.... boom vampires.
n2i917l5RFc,1:28
08Z3djT0h7A,From Robert Rodriguez The Creators of Spy Kids ❤️😍
sJZTlrQZMjY,If I'd see this trailer before I saw the movie I would be pretty pissed..glad I watched this awesome flick the first time without any idea what it's about.
r7kWQj9FCGY,What a throwback. It’s cool to see such a well known director in his infancy. Did Quentin Tarantino really think that George Clooney was believable as his brother though? Come on.
yUp6d79WRVI,The most beautiful woman turning into a monster this is something I definitely don't wanna watch
ElzIPn1pXWE,"Wow, Quentin Tarantino is playing movie"
_nAIb_J9T5M,Diqhzw

ye4KFyWu2do,They stole a track from James Horner's ALIENS O.S.T. to create the trailer.
6KnSucVko1s,When I first saw this movie when it first came out...had no idea it was about vampires 🧛‍♂️ this was brilliant on ever level!! Quentin T's mind is mind blowing. All of his movies are gooood.

SDQDwoFe6Ko,"If you were Quentin Tarantino, and your brother looked like George Clooney, wouldn't you go psycho too?"
xetPWLjrZCc,Back in the day when Harvey Keitel was a bigger star than George Clooney.
5CJRnRyA4wA,who voiced this trailer? HAL DOUGLAS?  DON LAFONTAINE?
Ut06d4dptWo,Kates feetare so wowe in film
-E10AcydCuk,"Long intro almost forget what movies about, till."
CjgwUB1CXek,I remember wanting to rent this movie when it first came out when i was in middle school. It was always rented out every week. And finally we grab it and we enjoyed every min of it.
NNw_ar7XVyQ,watched this for the first time at a friends house with no idea it was a vampire movie was a great twist
dCVh4lBfW-c,"1:19  - Welcome to slavery.
          - No, thanks. I've already had a wife!
 Hahahah best part, and my favourit!"
_QHkdKZtG_o,From dusk till Dawn movie from the beginning when I was coming up when I first saw it I like old school old movies old vampire movies old Godzilla movies and stuff like that not all this movies without his other things in it is a wonderful movie it deals with the imagination of vampires and it got sorcery in it 🌎💜🖤😍😎
SHqZh-9AiCs,Remember watching this movie at 16 or so and I totally did not see the vampire thing coming. Even my mum who is not into Tartintino movies enjoyed it.
B3NJ49VyjDs,This is my kind of place 😂
-RLVfo4SZfg,"Man, the 90's had the best trailers! They always knew how to pump you up."
IICdZuA97hY,If someone sees this trailer before the movie basically ruins the whole film
VApVpvcGW1A,Great.
CvHp7xJZ4_U,i would really love to see a remake of this really badass vampire movie because the From Dusk Till Dawn the tv series really sucked i don't even know why Robert Rodriguez the director of the movie wanted to make a lame ass tv show of his own badass movie because From Dusk Till Dawn is one of my ultimate favorite vampire movies it had action horror & humor & George Clooney had the best one liners in the entire movie & Salma Hayek was a very hot & sexy vampire & Danny Trejo was very awesome as the vampire bartender & of course they had to ruind this cult movie with 2 stupid ass sequels that had nothing to do with the first movie so i want either a real sequel to this very cool vampire movie or a remake i Wonder what this movie would look like if they made a remake of it but i prefer a real sequel that continues the story of the first movie & not those lame & stupid ass sequels they made or that dumb ass tv show because that show really sucked donkey balls so did those lame ass sequels bring back George Clooney & Juliette Lewis
RYA2q2Sm_Jo,When i was very young my father was watching this movie he didnt let me watch it but he fell asleep and i saw the monsters and i remember i was very very scared and i had nightmares for a long time.. As i got older i was trying to find this movie so i watch it and the memory of my childhood terror will fade away but all i could remember was 'monster' so i couldnt find it because of many monster movies.. And this isn't even a monster movie.. Its a vampire movie.. I'll watch it now that i found it!

http://louiselake.blogspot.com﻿"
5Sg2RkdkSvk,I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say this movie was 80% shit.
46HQAq2te-M,The thing is they filmed this movie in a way were the audience just about forgets that it's a vampire movie in the first thirty minutes.  I thought it was brilliant.  I think they shouldn't have even advertised it as a vampire movie.  THAT would have thrown the audience for a loop. 
vtfwgaHD5_w,trailer basically gives the whole movie away
d9TFEXgD6go,Sin City? You don't like Sin City? That movie is a fucking master piece. 
4RBXypX4qWI,this is the only Robert Rodriguez movie i really like and it's probably because Tarantino wrote it

2nlkEY-3CMI,That music is from Aliens.
0cOrwS3Xihw,"Wow, the English translation really toned down the vulgarity of what is said at 0:36. ""Klaar voor de dek"", that refers to taking a cow to get bred by a bull for the first time."
pZ3CQ-wtX_A,One of the best films.

zPYuV_jGk7M,I identify with the priest as he divests himself of priestly robes and runs through town dancing and hanging from church bell ropes. I love the Crooked Finger character and his depth of observations of life challenge my churchianity and make me want to understand philosophers like him or live and die trying.
ReIJ1lbL-Q8,This one of the best movies 🎥 I've ever seen in my life ♥
2GfZl4kuVNI,That Really good sense ❤️❤️💕💕💕😍

2WGq2Rbs1Qg,this is a beautiful film
O4HrGa2-RLc,"My first ""arthouse"" movie I went to see on my own when my local old small town cinema changed ownership from a bored purveyor of blockbusters 3 or 4 weeks after everyone had seen them in the nearest big town to someone who mixed commercial movies with foreign and arthouse movies, for a few years. I had ticket 001 for Antonia's Line, the first film screened under new management."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"La recomiendo totalmente, es de las mejores películas que he visto. Vale la pena verla varias veces."

5nSlJSfnkWc,"The preview was very wierd. The guy was not what I expected. I thought it would be like a Jean-Claude Van Damme film. Something like a young man that gets attacked by criminal gangs and has to start to defend himself. Maybe flash a firearm to scare away a thug. You can definitely sense there is a clear delusion of vigilantism. That's where it takes a turn from self-defense, into kind of mindset of actively seeking violence as a vigilante. No batman at all. Considering that Robert De Niro is so far left and anti-gun, he would have loved to chance to present a right-wing guy as a total nutcase. Nothing could be further from the truth in the right wing we try to avoid any and all conflict until the very last second."

The Man is a Ticking time Bomb !   Almost All his Movie Rolls He played a Psycho ! A Gangster ! A Foul mouthed Crude Human ! And in in I think it was from anywhere of 2019 to 2020 he ranted and Raved about Trump ! 
And This movie was the Real DeNiro to me ! 
This Movie was Horrible It made NO sense whatsoever !

Ut9GvlhB9f4,"Jackie Chan is and always shall be an artist, an actor, an entertainer and a true professional. Too bad I can't say the same about many of the people he's been Rushed to work with just to get a new movie out by the exact Hour they want.😮"

p97ds4ZR7zM,Great movie!
wJK-Djc3AFw,Jackie is why I WILL NEVER WATCH WIRE-FU
WHrWFve2_0c,"""he does all his own stunts""

Who you trying to kid? I've seen very often that Jacky doesn't do ALL his own stunts. Sure he does probably way more stunts than any other actor. But just for example because it's only 2 days since I re-watched Action Hunter I guess. Have a look at that boss fiht st the end when he does his side-spinning kick. It's shows one time in slow motion and one time normal motion. you guys really need to watch a bit closer or more carefully and not just believe anything that anyone tells you."

It was a complete adventure for me and my friends as we were only young and wouldn't normally head into the city at night but it was only showing at the city centre Odeon!  We were already JC fans but this movie literally blew me away - the fight scenes, the stunts, the humour... it was and still is a masterpiece!  We came out of the theatre and headed to the bus station and I can remember looking nervously down every alleyway for 'gangs' who might chase us on motorbikes ;)  A night I'll never forget... thanks Jackie Chan! :D"

_ckWTn-y5Rw,"Dating myself here, saw Rumble In the Bronx in the Theatre, when I was 11 years old back in '95. It was and still is one of my favourite action, material arts movies. The stunts were amazing for the time. I had never seen a movie where a guy is being chased by the bad guys and has to jump from a parking parade to an apartment balcony! expect maybe the movie Marathon Man with  Dustin Hoffman (similar idea) two years later Mr.Nice Guy came out another awesome movie that i had wished i had seen in the theatre. The 90's were a great time to still go to the movies, it used to cost me as a kid $5 to go to the movies ha good luck with that now days!"

The Keeley's daughter Barbara is supposed to be 17 but played by Flockhart who's 32? Well, nevertheless it all passed, which is a testament to the Hollywood Maybelline machine. 😎👍"

I worked at a gas station/convenience store then, and my friends came and helped me close the place up at midnight, cleaning everything while I did the register so we could hit the road at exactly midnight to make the 12:15 AM show. We had a blast and the movie was so good we did it all over again the following night. (Fun fact, my very cool Pakistani boss complimented me on the cleanup job when I didn't do a damn thing except count the money...the 90s were good times)"

m01YktiEZCw,"The first ""bad boys"" was more genuine than the sequels. It was about a halfway believable storyline and the death toll and other wreckage was in the realm of realistic to real life cases. Performances by Smith and Lawrence as well as the rest of the cast was excellent."

Combine that with an all-star cast, the campy romance, and some fantastical set and prop design… it’s one of the best Batman movies if not THE best."

M6DsFyC9l-U,What's with this music? It's about as far removed from the atmosphere of this movie as possible. It just gives the impression the people who made this trailer tried to deceive their audience into believing this movie is something it's not; as if it's some kind of inane drama about the injustice of the prostitution business like it would probably be written today. Don't treat your audience this way.

The 90s Roulette podcast does a great breakdown of the movie and the two characters in one of their episodes

u8tVk61sHsQ,"A movie that offers nothing great at since it has been seen in other submarine movies made before . ""The Hunt for Red October"" has exact the same story , with the same mutiny case and other action scenes . 

Crimson Tide use the same over the top music and other soundtrack heard in action movies during the 90's era . Airforce One ( Harrison Ford ) , The Rock ( Nicolas Case & Sean Connery ) to name a couple ...

Sure it has some excellent cast in the movie Gene Hackman & a new Denzel Washington back then . But yes the fame and glory from this movie falls only because it's a ""Tony Scott"" movie at least this movie you could enjoy the movie now his later movies Domino or Men on Fire where you couldn't see sh*t going on because shaking cameras why i hate Tony Scott for that ( somehow the same with those who made Jason Bourne trilogy some action scenes from James Bond the Daniel Craig era and other movies from that era ) 

Anyway this movie is just a plain remake from ""The Caine Mutiny"" . 

Too many clichés and stereotypes are seen in this movie which makes it somehow sad to take it as a serious movie .

- again the Russians were the bad guys for no reasons , we can already see how the American country acts as it's media seen in the movie itself .

- bad guy Gene Hackman is a lost veteran in the army facing a new generation that ....

- The colors used in the submarine same as The Hunt of Red October is ridiculous ( green , blue, red , etc...)

- The dog Gene Hackman use is just an easter egg already seen in The Longest Day . 

- This movie uses the same plot as the Officers Men ( Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Jack Nicholson ) 

- Later on the movie K19 The Widowmaker ( Harrison Ford & Liam Neeson ) offers the exact same plot besides the mutiny for one and the nuclear problem for the other .

This movie isn't original at all . The only actor that steals the whole movie is Gene Hackman ."
_t7ubr0jBII,"""On a U.S. nuclear missile sub, a young First Officer stages a mutiny, to prevent his trigger happy Captain from launching his missiles, before confirming his orders to do so.""

What?!  The orders to launch WERE confirmed.  The orders that WEREN'T confirmed were the stand down orders.  The XO staged a mutiny based on unauthenticated orders."

DZ7Fm26YJjs,"""On a U.S. nuclear missile sub, a young First Officer stages a mutiny, to prevent his trigger happy Captain from launching his missiles, before confirming his orders to do so.""

Did you even watch the movie? This description is so wrong... BOTH men were right and wrong at the same time! THAT is what makes this movie so good! The First Officer did not mutiny, he removed his captain due to his improper request to have the First Officer replaced. The captain isn't trigger happy by any means and his orders WERE confirmed, so he was acting as protocol dictated!"

sth8EmI2y6g,"For all those here because of Jordan Peterson, i have a better one for you.
Look up ""A dangerous dynasty: house of Assad"" by the BBC.
Nevermind Crumb. The Assad's reign (current + father) brought about death and destruction to hundred's of thousands of syrians. His conflicting personalities; the eye surgeon, lover of life and the arts - the hero, and Assad the brutal cold-blooded enigmatic despot - the antihero. 
Feeling unloved and unappreciated by a powerful mother who sees you as being a coward betraying your late god-like father, for not cracking down, and who wills nothing but brute force as the only solution. As Jerrold Post put it, a father so powerful, you imagine him sitting on your shoulder, going ""*tut* *tut* *tut*"" as you make decisions. 
A highly intelligent, and loving man, but extremely manipulative, machiavellian, deadly and dysfunctional. 

Go watch that documentary!"

Robert's raw scathing unapologetic satirical artistic style laid bare the sickness beneath the surface of the middle class suburban American normalcy that Robert grew up in and around.

After reading tons of Robert's material growing up, it was amazing to not only get to know the man behind them, but the oftentimes strange genesis from which they sprang."

Thanks to Jordan Peterson, and the likes of him, who are helping me look beyond what I just mentioned.

Men, you are the creators of the world, you are the creators of your own soul, so don't let any of the circumstances make you doubt your self worth. It's okay to feel weak, for in that feeling, lies a sinister ""ohhhhh you have no idea how I am gonna come back bitch"" smile 😼.

Stay strong brothers, NO ONE is a loser, we are all Winners, in the making. Just take the hits and learn how to counter them and move ahead. Survive now and slowly build upon it. 

One day, all this will make sense and will be in the past, while you'll be sitting on your throne, with peace 😌

Good luck Men 🤞😌👍"

65tMREjQXAQ,"If you are younger than 40 its hard to know exactly how prophetic this movie was.  When this came out, the technology the movie is based around seemed like an outlandishly bad and overblown sci-fi movie plot. None of this technology existed; nor was it a given that it would exist in the future. It was still just a silicon valley fever dream at best. There weren't any publicly (or privately) available wireless internet connections, no infrastructure, no hardware and no software developed that would support a narrative like this in any real way. By the time eagle eye came out is was a much easier narrative to swallow, we could at least see where the tech was headed. But  at the time this movie was so far out that it became a joke."
hdQZXUOHGMs,It’s not just films though; Look at the book 1984 and think of Big Brother vs The patriot act

zqdn9UU4upo,"It's crazy how we are moving backwards. This was released in 1995 and now....we are banning cross dressing, banning books and trying to pray the gay away. The 90s were so much better!"
Il4j_0R1doE,"If this movie came out today, conservatives would've ban it or send threats to movie theaters."
j1x5PJ0SY8Y,"I always thought this movie was a particularly bold career move from both Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes, especially in 1995 and given their work before that.  This trailer sets it up beautifully."
UAOv53cR1iw,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. It has drama, comedy and the crying moment. Loved it."
,I loved this movie
mUj1m_iQAJo,This trailer made me uncomfortable as a kid.
JjUEjBYVtS0,I can’t believe these characters played In this trashy movie promoting that garbage that we see everywhere today
LHLMmuY5Zg0,"I always feel that this was a slight ripoff of 'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'."
milpphMpv9M,"Honestly, this is a must-see movie for anybody who is into the art of drag, and a sad reminder that we've somehow reversed back to a more hateful time. If this movie was released today, there'd be protests at movie theatres up the ass by idiot ""children protectors"" who...get this... don't have to let their kids see it, especially since it'd be an R-rated movie."

phsP6RbDOXI,This was not a movie it was a theatrical master piece.
2mA53X_ruUY,Can you imagine releasing this movie today.  Back then yes it was a comedy you could laugh at.  Today something like this would offend people up and down.

QlZpb28ztFc,I despised  and envied John Leguizamo for years after this movie. He makes  such and attractive woman.  Better make up and he would have been stunning.

OHc23vfhwUU,thanks for everything
UdFvWNY93cU,"Dude. If Wesley Snipes, Jon Leguizamo, and Keanu Reeves were to do a reboot or second movie to this, that would be the best. 

Yes. I know. Keanu wasn’t in it, but he’d be a great replacement or addition. Do a First Wives Club inspired sequel!  They hear from Keanu’s character after the drag queen Patrick Swayze played, dies. 

Vida Boem? Idk. 



And let’s not let it be woke. Make it from the perspective of a straight guy interpreting the life of a DRAG QUEEN, aka, female impersonators."
mk1AK-G6UF4,Loved it.
UyW46Pbsp9k,"Funny thing is, they used to be women. But, they pushed the wrong button."
NpY2QcnH5D8,Outstanding trailer vs blockbusterter movie 🙄🙄🙄
sZGxXI632sk,I ❤️ this movie.
MMcBEOvxXj4,"I'm watching lately movies with Swayze and this one was a stupendous surprise. I thought the idea - three drag queens travel to Hollywood will be something light, aiming at humour and entertaiment yet it touches some really serious topics, gives happy ending to each unhappy character. This is one beautiful movie. It was great to watch, great to be surprised by how it developed. And watching Swayze as this classy lady... extraordinary, like ... wow! ... he got into his character with all the body language - if I wasn't that struck by the story i would be recommending to watch this movie even just to see him as Vida Boheme."

P28qmkCrNSM,three good actor.
J5mszOh_Qis,"What's funny is how many scenes are in the trailer that were cut from the film.  The line ""Easy rider in dresses"" doesn't appear in theatrical release. Though the extended restaurant scene with that line is on the DVD extras Deleted and Extended.  Which actually helps flesh the movie out more.  The final scene of the trailer of them on a mountain road, the entire scene is cut and replaced.   They almost get hit by a bus and Chi Chi gets step one then.  In the movie step one is achieved in the car.  They show them on the road they almost get hit on, but skip the scene and replace all with voiceovers."
mqTrjDsEg4g,"YES. Even if you don't support the idea, the message is real. Don't judge it until you watch it.....walk away for a few weeks...watch it again....wait a couple more days, and you may get it. Being a woman is not a picnic either guys...and ""Women need to be TAUGHT YO SUPPORT EACH OTHER, because that's not something taught on the playground""- Pink quote"

They are not transgendered they're drag artists. Just had to say that... the magical 'other' save everyone's life and love. But fun!"

Ks5eE-lTFDw,"Same voice, same character in every film and sketch he's ever appeared in . Adam Sandler is the least talented actor on the planet barr none. His limited range is beyond embarrassing, how he ever managed to fool anyone into thinking he was funny, talented, or remotely entertaining is beyond me ."
QJhtT0KGvdg,"I'm not saying this is a bad movie cause I did enjoy it, but I find it amazing that anyone actually went to see this after seeing the trailer. I would've stopped watching after the first 30 seconds"

noSrT4BgwB0,If you ever wonder why Adam Sandler doesn't make movies anymore just watch this trashfire. Billy's character starts and ends the movie being an unlikable dunce and he learns nothing of value along the way. At least Happy Gilmore had Bob Barker in it.

All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). God is holy and the punishment for sin is Hell. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23). Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life (John 14:6). He died on the cross and rose again on the third day for us all. Repent of your sins, believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him into your heart and follow Him."

ayhyRRhCmzM,"Dude that sucked. This movie is special and this preview did NOT do it justice at all. I remember being 13 and thinking I was getting away with something just viewing it. I’ve made so many references out loud that people sometimes get/don’t get and I don’t plan on stopping. “37?!” “A bunch of savages in this town.” “Do you have the one with that guy who was in that thing last year?” “Make like a circus seal.” “Life is a series of down endings.”  (I use the last one at least once a week. I also try and incorporate the word “ruse” in conversation purposefully because a lot of people don’t know the meaning and it makes me sound smart. I know, the shame."
