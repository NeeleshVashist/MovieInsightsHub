## Introduction

MovieInsightsHub is a recommender system project designed to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and emotions. It leverages collaborative filtering and hybrid techniques to suggest movies to users. Additionally, it incorporates sentiment analysis of YouTube comments related to movies to enhance the recommendations.

## Features

- Collaborative Recommender System: Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to make movie recommendations based on user-item interactions.
- Hybrid Recommender System: Combines collaborative filtering predictions with sentiment-driven personalization from YouTube comments' sentiment analysis.
- Sentiment Analysis: Incorporates TextBlob and VADER sentiment analysis to understand viewer emotions from YouTube comments.
- User Engagement Enhancement: Provides movie recommendations that resonate emotionally with users, enhancing their overall experience.

## Methodology

The project's methodology includes the following key steps:

1. Data Preparation: Gathering and cleaning movie ratings, metadata, and YouTube comments.
2. Collaborative Recommender System: Implementing matrix factorization, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), for prediction.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Using TextBlob and VADER to analyze sentiments of YouTube comments related to movies.
4. Hybrid Recommender System: Combining collaborative predictions with sentiment scores to create a personalized recommendation system.
